                    How long should the presentation be?  
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Invited Speakers (typically professionals): 
                    Presentation duration of approximately 30 minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contributed Speakers (typically students): 
                    Presentation duration of approximately 10 minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the topic, the presenter's convenience, and the 
                    total number of speakers this could be tweaked.

                    Would the presentation be only for the online event or also for the in-person 
                    event?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    There would be presentations in both virtual and in-person events. 
                    In-person presentations are typically allotted for presenters from UMD 
                    and nearby locations. But, presenters from other locations are welcome 
                    to present if they wish to do so. The virtual event is designed to help 
                    make it easier for non-UMD presenters.

                    Will there be separate sessions for high school and college students, or will 
                    they all be mixed together?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    As we are trying to introduce students from various backgrounds to sustainability,
                    we believe that talks from various perspectives and topics would be really 
                    helpful. Hopefully, make students connect the dots and help them think in a 
                    way they did not know. One can understand that most topics would inherently 
                    be a technical session but it would be great if the presenter is mindful of 
                    the audience from different categories.

                    Do I need to have a finished or complete research project in order to present a poster?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Contrary to what is required of you by most research conferences, we want to 
                    emphasize the value of projects that are still “in process.” We 
                    understand that often times your results may not come when you 
                    expect them to, and do not want this to be a barrier for anyone who 
                    would like to converse with their peers on what they are trying to accomplish,
                     because sometimes external input is even more valuable in the middle of your 
                     process then at the end of it. Sustainability for all, right?
